# dfs-visualizer
This project is built to visualize how dfs algorithms work to find the expanded nodes and the final path of a graph, the supported algorithms are:
1- Depth First Search.
2- Limited Depth First Search.
3- Iterative deepening search.

# Project structure
This project is divided into 5 files, they are:
1- algorithms.py : Contains the raw algorithms code. i.e:dfs and depth_limited_search.

| function  | usage |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| dfs(graph,start,goal)  | Returns the expanded nodes and the final path when visualizing dfs |
| depth_limited_search(graph,start,goal)  | Returns the expanded nodes and the final path when visualizing depth_limited_search  |

2- helper.py : Contains helper functions that are commonly

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

closeGraph() and showGraph().
